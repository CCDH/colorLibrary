## Prerequisites

To use this library you only need to download and link the script file in your body at the bottom.

```
<script src="js/colorLibrary.js"></script>
```

## How it works

To choose a color you first need to know if the color was meant as a header-color, main-color or accent-color.

Next u place your (color-name) in HTML-Tags

```
<header class="header-color"></header>
```

If you want to use the default color you won't need to choose a color. If you do want to use a color you can choose between these colors:
- red
- pink
- purple
- deeppurple
- indigo
- blue
- lightblue
- cyan
- teal
- green
- lightgreen
- lime
- yellow
- amber
- orange
- deeporange
- brown
- grey
- bluegrey

Just place your color next to the header-color, main-color or accent-color classname.

```
<header class="header-color deeppurple"></header>
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
